Alogrithm implemention on Ebola metadata
========================================

/*
Variable “A” was assigned to load data from the file system (hdfs). Our selected fields of interest in the ebola metadata are country, 
locality, category, value and sources.
Assign another variable B to hold each “A” that we assigned to only country,locality,category,value.
Assign C to hold only the distinct (different) of B.
limit the values generated by c to only 100
*/

grunt>B= foreach A generate country,locality,category,value;
grunt>C= distinct B;
grunt>D= limit C 100;
